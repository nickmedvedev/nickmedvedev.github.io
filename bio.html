            <p aria-labelledby="Biography"> I’m a Junior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science. It’s been an absolute pleasure to experience everything that the University has had to offer as well as applying myself and succeeding in areas I never would have expected and slowly accomplishing my goals day by day, utilizing the supportful environment and community around me.

                <br>
                When I’m away from my computer, you can usually find me going for a run somewhere around the Bahá'í House of Worship, bursting every blood vessel I have left at the gym (SPAC), doing something spontaneous, or grabbing a snack at the nearby 7/11.
                <br>
                <br>
                In June 2024, I will finally graduate and be on the way to pursuing whatever it is that I end up doing.
